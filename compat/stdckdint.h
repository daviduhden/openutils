/*
 * <stdckdint.h> compatibility shim.
 *
 * Every C23 translation unit in this project uses the checked integer
 * arithmetic macros from <stdckdint.h>.  Clang accepts -std=c23, but
 * the header belongs to the C library, and a system can have a
 * C23-capable compiler while its libc still lacks the header (OpenBSD
 * at the time of writing).  Because compat/ is on the include path
 * (-I), this file shadows the system header:
 *
 *   - when a real <stdckdint.h> is reachable after compat/ in the
 *     include search order, it is included and used unchanged;
 *   - otherwise ckd_add(), ckd_sub() and ckd_mul() are provided with
 *     the compiler's overflow builtins.
 *
 * __has_include_next() and #include_next (instead of __has_include()
 * and #include) are essential here: compat/ precedes the system
 * directories, so a plain include would find this very file again and
 * recurse instead of reaching the real header.  include_next resumes
 * the search after compat/, which cannot match this file.  Both are
 * GCC/Clang extensions; they are confined to this portability shim,
 * and the fallback below relies on those same compilers anyway.
 *
 * OPENUTILS_STDCKDINT_FORCE_FALLBACK exists so that the test suite can
 * exercise the fallback on hosts whose libc already provides the
 * header.  The build never defines it.

 *
 * C23 specifies ckd_add(result, a, b) as computing the mathematical
 * (infinite precision) value of a + b, converting it to the type of
 * *result, storing it in *result, and returning true exactly when the
 * conversion is not value-preserving.  The operands are not first
 * converted to a common type.  __builtin_add_overflow(a, b, result)
 * has that exact contract: it promotes a and b to infinite precision,
 * converts the mathematical result to the type of *result, stores it
 * and reports whether the conversion changed the value.  GCC's own
 * <stdckdint.h> is defined in these very terms, so this fallback
 * matches the real header for the standard integer types used by the
 * project.  Each operand is evaluated exactly once.
